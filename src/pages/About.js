            I am a Developer-turned Product Manager, passionate about building scalable and empowering products that meet the users needs.
            I am a Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. In my free time, I like to go on hikes, learn new songs on my ukulele, and grow my vibrant garden.
